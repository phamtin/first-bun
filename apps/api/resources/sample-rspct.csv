58mbft	teenmom	"So what was Matt ""addicted"" to?"	Did he ever say what his addiction was or is he still chugging beers while talking about how sober he is?<lb><lb>Edited to add: As an addict myself, anyone I know whose been an addict doesn't drink and in the group I go to (similar to NA and AA) drinking is considered a slip-up. Has he said what he's addicted to or is he still talking out of his ass, winging it as he goes?
8f73s7	Harley	No Club Colors	Funny story. I went to college in Las Vegas. This was before I knew anything about motorcycling whatsoever. Me and some college buddies would always go out on the strip to the dance clubs. We always ended up at a bar called Hogs &amp; Heifers. It's worth noting the females working there can outdrink ANYONE. Anyway, there was a sign on the front door that read 'No Club Colors'. So we lose our ties and blazers before heading there. Also we assumed bright colors like red, yellow, green etc were not allowed. So we would always bring an xtra t-shirt and pair of jeans. This went on for years! Looking back now on how naive we were, it's just hilarious. I was never able to walk out of that bar....had to crawl out! So much booze. <lb><lb>Cheers. Ride safe, boys! 
6ti6re	ringdoorbell	Not door bell, but floodlight mount height.	I know this is a sub for the 'Ring Doorbell' but has anyone used the Floodlight?  I already have the wire and existing bracket for the floodlight on the back of my house, but the problem is that it's about 12 feet above ground level (10 ft above the deck, 2 ft drop from the deck down to the grass)<lb><lb>Is that too high to mount?  The website says 9 ft is ideal.  Anyone had any problems mounting it higher than that?
77sxto	intel	Worried about my 8700k small fft/data stress results...	"Prime95 (regardless of version) and OCCT both, the ""small"" tests (including those parts of blend) make my temps shoot up to 100c+/throttling even at pure stock with MCE off instantaneously (I find it mildly funny that this still passes in P95).    Any other stress test is lucky to spike up to 75 WITH an OC.   Real usage in say TW Warhammer 2 (what I believe is considered cpu heavy) is like low 60's.  I don't get it.<lb><lb>So, tell me this is normal/doesn't matter... please.   :-x<lb>"

6azhj1	rawdenim	Had a custom embroidery job done on my ranch jacket by one of our own!	[Album First](http://imgur.com/a/DYdKC)<lb><lb>So a while ago I had mentioned in a GD thread about wanting to have /u/superish64 do a custom embroidery job for me on my shadow selvedge ranch jacket, and about a week and a half ago we solidified everything.  I got the jacket back yesterday and needless to say he did an impeccable job, originally I wanted to do something pretty minimalist; however, I finally ended up on the design you see here (outline of MN and the state motto inside, as I was born and raised in Minneapolis) in a black thread so that the design is subtle but will become more apparent as the jacket fades.  It was a breeze working with Brad on this project as he was prompt in responding and was very open to any suggestions or ideas I had.  If I ever need a custom embroidery job again in the future he will be the first person I contact!<lb><lb>Also threw in some bonus pics of how my jacket is fading so far and the FREE selvedge beer coozie he sent with the finished product!

85bh8r	DBZDokkanBattle	Is Fusion nullified for the Extreme Z Awakening Event?	On JP I missed out on my chance to do SSJ3 Goku the first time so I’m doing it now. Been lucked out of rotations for most of these stages and I’ve noticed that for my Fusions team, LR Gogeta would NEVER fuse. I’m genuinely curious if the mechanic is nullified for the event or i’m just getting AWFUL RNG.
7jvsz7	Nootropics	Why the hell does vitamin D give me anxiety?	I’m really puzzled by this one, so I was hoping you guys could give me some theories. I’ve self diagnosed myself with SAD considering that I consistently feel terrible during the winter months. Given my personal circumstances I figured that my vitamin D levels are probably somewhere between really bad and abysmal, so I decided to supplement. I bought a bottle of 10,000 IU and took a dose, but ended up having an anxiety attack two hours later, which took me a week to get over. I did some research and found that most vitamin D side effects are a sign of magnesium deficiency, so I bought some high quality magnesium and lowered my vitamin D dose to 2,000 IU. I tried again, but had the same mental side effects. Does anyone have any idea what’s going on? The only thing I can think of is that I went off a low dose antidepressant recently, which maybe has somehow made my brain super sensitive to supplements. What do you guys think? I would love to keep taking vitamin D but can’t because of the anxiety.

7i2bt4	NameThatSong	Can anyone help me find this band?	"Thinking of 'who the band sounded like' brings Doorbell by The White Stripes to mind. The vocalist is a woman with a voice close to the style and tone of one from The Doorbell. I remember the album art - but the only hint I can suggest after all these years is the color selection from Arcade Fire's Funeral album cover - that orange tone, with slightly browner (I believe) shapes all over it, similarly twirled. The only other things my brain managed to squeeze seem unreliable and could prove misleading: for some reason, the word ""Dorothy"", or something that starts with D, as well as the word 'Gospel', this time embedded within the name of the band itself, gnaws at the back of the head. Googling any of these things proved futile. The album could be from the second half of the 90's / very early 2000. That's not much, does anyone know who on Earth I'm typing about?"
6zltab	homeless	About to be homeless in LA,CA	My parents have cost me my recent job and are increasing rent to kick me out. I was sick with a fever and called in but they called my boss and told him I was out with my gf and got fired (he's a family friend). <lb><lb>If anybody has ANY info on jobs that dont drug test (weed, didn't forsee this situation or I would've stopped a while back) please hmu.

4zpvar	antidepressants	Sexual performance anxiety	Throwaway here. I've been on sertraline 100mg for a few years now. In relationship with new woman the past few months, and find a number of occasions where I either can't get erect or lose erection after a few minutes. It's not always, but it's about half the time or more. GF is seriously feeling low-self-worth as a result and I'm very worried and trying to tell her it's me, not her. <lb><lb>The thing is I can masturbate without trouble. Obviously real sex is different than masturbation. I think it might be performance anxiety (sometimes it is also just exhaustion) -- not helped by her desperate desire to be sexually fulfilling/ed. But why would I have anxiety when I'm on antidepressants? Perhaps it is the dreaded sexual dysfunction side effects of SSRIs? Should I consider reducing my dose? Can't see my doctor until October.

6k5oct	Garmin	Just bought a Forerunner 35 and I have a question about the Weather function!	"Is it not supposed to update regularly?  It seems like the weather function only changes when I sync the watch to the app.  It's always synced mind you but I have to whip out my phone and actively check the app if I want the weather on my watch to update.  At that point I can just check my weather app on my phone.  Sorry if this doesn't make sense!  Overall I love the watch, first GPS/""smart"" watch ever.  "
65x241	dpdr	Instead of tackling my DPDR, i'm going to tackle my depression and anxiety first	I'll update in a month or two, but this is going to be my new approach. I've come to the conclusion that whatever is the main cause of my DPDR, that it's been here for years and years and years and the depression and anxiety aren't helping it. So they have become my new problem to fix first.
4srim7	AskLiteraryStudies	Recommend Interdisciplinary Lit Grad programs?	So, I'm looking to apply to grad school this fall (I'm terrified and totally lacking in confidence) and I have three programs that I want to apply to: Stanford's Modern Thought and Lit program, U of Chicago's Comp Lit, and U of Oregon's Comp Lit. However, I feel like it might be better to maybe apply to maybe another program of two. I'm definitely interested in Comp Lit but my interests are leaning away from the national literature route and more towards interdisciplinary. Unfortunately, I haven't found many programs that are like that....would anyone have any suggestions or recommendations?

5byyav	shrimptank	Setting up a 10 gallon - what do I need?	I'm in the process of setting up a 10 gallon. I want to keep ghost shrimp, red cherry shrimp, and/or eventually blue velvet shrimp. So far I have a heater and some wood. I have some black sand, some more wood, some lights and a filter coming in the mail. I already have 6 other tanks set up, so I'm experienced with fish tanks, I just haven't kept freshwater shrimp before so I guess I'm just looking for some tips. Suggestions for plants? Decoration suggestions? I also plan to hopefully keep a betta with them.

8bx4nb	synthesizers	Playing Synths in a Band: How to make yourself heard?	So I know that this subreddit is filled with fellow bedroom producers, MIDI mavens, and multitrack fiends. Presumably, though, some of you also leave the house to perform with human beings who play other instruments. I've done it a few times, and I wonder how others make their synths heard.<lb><lb>If you've ever been in a crappy space with overeager guitarists, excitable drummers, and bassists, you know how tough it can be to make your pristine synth tones audible. How do you all make it work? Do you use dedicated keyboard amps, plug into PAs, or just employ a spare solid state amp?
55efs0	gravityfalls	A thought about Stanley's memory being erased	"In society of the blind eye, we see that the way the memory gun ( hope that's the name) works is you write the thing you want the person to forget and then shoot. In weirdmageddon, Ford writes Stanley Pines in the gun and then erase Stan's memory. That got me thinking: Stan has been living Ford's life for 30 years, right? So by erasing ""stanley pines"" of stan's mind, it would erase his memories being stanley but not the ones where he was faking he was stanford, and then he could start thinking he was Ford. It might be a stretch, but I think it's a cool what if."

6gvxop	dndnext	Help with Ranged Battlemaster Maneuvers!	Hi, I recently hit level 7 in our SKT campaign. I'm playing a Variant Human ranged Battlemaster, with Sharpshooter and Xbow expert.<lb><lb>At level 7 you learn 2 more maneuvers, but I'm really conflicted about which ones to pick. Currently I have:<lb><lb>Precision Attack<lb><lb>Menacing Attack<lb><lb>Pushing Attack<lb><lb>and I have no idea what to pick for the level 7 ones. Trip attack looks decent, but our party is a full ranged one except for a Barbarian, so knocking people prone would be mostly a disadvantage for us. Rally is cool but it eats up my bonus action and I only have 12 Charisma anyway. Disarming attack sounds promising but I'm ranged and the weapon just falls at their feet where they can just pick it up again as a free action. Defensive maneuvers sound useless as my DM never even bothers to get to me in melee, mostly because of our Sentinel Barbarian locking people down.<lb><lb>What do you guys suggest? Thanks!<lb><lb>Edit: thanks to everyone for the thorough answers! It really helped me realize the potential of all the maneuvers I didn't consider to be  very powerful. I'm probably going for Maneuvering Attack and either Goading for disadvantage on fear immune creatures or Trip Attack for giving my barb  (and my cleric likes to melee too) easier targets, or execution style kills from 5ft away with my xbow (it's really a pistol, but just for fluff).

5vrtom	MtvChallenge	Am I the only Bananas fan on this forum?	I understand he's not everyone's cup of tea, but even if you hate his personality, the show thrives with him as a cast member. Bananas is the perfect narrator (calculating and self-aware) and competitor (abrasive personality and strong athlete). Everyone is saying how they want him to skip a few challenges or retire, but the last time Bananas sat out a Challenge there wasn't that season-long narration that helped carry the story. Think about it this way... Now that Bananas is in the Oasis, you won't have to listen to quite as much Nelson narration.

8dasa5	harrypotter	Better idea for Fantastic beast adaptation?	I fell asleep watching the Fantastic Beast movie so I’m guessing it wasn’t great.  I feel like it would be really well adapted into a TV show (not much knowledge on media rights).  Each chapter would be an episode and use different characters to show the discovery or a crazy moment involving the creature.  
5p8r7a	TryingForABaby	A bit confused / disappointed / first official introduction	This whole trying for a baby thing is quite new to me. My husband and I got married in July in a destination that was rated level 2 for the Zika Virus. <lb>I personally wanted to start trying for children right away. I'm 31 well into my teaching career in Canada (I could be in a better position but I'm still in a pretty good position compared to some people). Unfortunately the Zika virus caught us off guard. <lb>So, it has been six months, I have never been on female birth control in my entire life. I would say I'm pretty in tune with my body. I have never had an abortion and honestly I have never had to pee on a pregnancy test. <lb>I have taken the day after pill twice in my life. Once when I was 16 and the condom broke and once after we returned from our wedding. (I know we were stupid. We were just so glad to be married). <lb><lb>Regardless, my confusion is based on what the apps and information state about CM and about the whole checking of the cervix. <lb><lb>I am so new and such a noob at all of this. But Ive been learning and tracking. So I have never really tracked my period. But I always felt it came on time and for the past 2 years I have been scheduling 4-5 week sugaring appointments successfully between periods without tracking. So I'd like to think I'm pretty on time. <lb><lb>I started using Glow (I've read that its not the best, but Im not into temping yet and glow is so much prettier) and it said that I was fertial the 9th to the 15th. I had sex the 7th, 13th and 15th. Then my husband got man sick (yuck). I experienced EWCM the 15th a couple days ago and then just now (like 20 min ago). I have only ever really experienced it while on the toilet the clear part hanging from your body to the water. <lb><lb>So my question is: Is this actually EWCM? is my ovulation schedule off? does it mean that I'm fertile during the entire EWCM period even though I have only experienced it those three times. I would say that it was water and slidy between those dates. <lb><lb><lb>sorry Im such a noob Im just trying to learn. I was going to buy a pregnancy test today but then it freaked me out because it would be the first time peeing on a test and I wanted it to be a more realistic time frame.
7vfotc	sewing	How do I get in contact with skilled seamstresses?	I have a business that makes custom products out of stretch fabric, which takes a high level of skill to work with. I want to keep manufacturing in the US, but have found it challenging to find large manufacturing companies with seamstresses skilled enough to meet our standards (our product cannot be made by industrial machines). <lb><lb>I've found a few seamstresses in my local area that have done a great job working from home once they've been trained to make our products, but am now needing to expand. <lb><lb>I was wondering if anyone in this sub could point me in the right direction as to where to get in contact with skilled seamstresses interested in contracting work. Any help is appreciated! <lb><lb>*edited industrial sewing machine. Brothers sewing machine has been our in-house sewing machine of choice*

8ka4kl	madmen	Most Underrated Scene? Drunk Ted Chaugh visiting Frank Gleason in the hospital (S6 E6)	Rewatching (again) and was stunned by this scene and how subtly great it is. You get an inside look into 2 fairly new characters but it feels so natural and calm. This is also when Ted describes Don in such an eloquent way, it feels so relatable and you just want them to keep talking. I always enjoy the other characters analysis of Don and this is one of the best. You know in an instant Ted is a character worthy of Mad Men. Not the best scene by any means, but deserves one of the most underrated.
72i155	JUSTNOMIL	Quick advice needed	So I just wrote out an incredibly long post with hopes of posting multiple screenshots,  but I somehow messed up ( I'll take help on that too!) <lb><lb>Ive posted here a few times before and later deleted said posts so I'm really familiar with the NC letters and the cease and desist letters attorneys send out. <lb><lb>My 7 year old son got a 4 page letter in the mail today from my late husband's mother.  Our relationship has been a series of NC, LC rinse and repeat. After the last 6 month span where MIL ( who lives 3 miles from us) didn't so much as text and ask about my son I told her she was wrong to expect him for Christmas.  I went on to block her on my phone but she's been blocked from social Media for years.  <lb><lb>In may she made a pity me Facebook post about not being invited to his 7th birthday party which I neither planned nor put out invites for because it was hosted by a group.  This party ended up with a lot of media coverage and with my son being interviewed a few times.  <lb><lb>So she posted, had a lot of people pity her and say she has grandparents rights.  I was made aware of his post and contacted her ( really I lost my shit about her making his birthday about her, because everything had to be about her sadness and pain).  I told her all of her second third and forth chances were done.  She doesn't even know him when she sees him, he doesn't know here AT ALL. <lb><lb>She ramped it up a bit and sent him a few cards this summer.  Today he got a 4 page letter in the mail that was absolutely sickening.   She tells him how his daddy would want him to see her and the family ( husband didn't want some of them in our sons life at all), how she wants to see him,  wants him to cash his birthday Check.  Why did he cash his ( 7 dollar) birthday check??  A lot of guilt and manipulation clearly directed to me. <lb><lb>So,  I read great things about NC and cease and desist letters.  I need this to stop after  sickening 7 year cycle.  I spent two years in therapy crying not over being a young widow, but about these fucking shit in laws.  <lb><lb>Do I need to send a no contact letter first?<lb><lb>How goes the process of seeking a cease and desist? <lb><lb>I need all my ducks in a row.  Last year I was made aware the family had discussed trying to get custody of my son which would NEVER happen because I'm a pretty good mom and they all are alcoholics with DUIs, records, health issues and anger issues.  My family is so incredibly supportive.  <lb><lb>I can financially spend a decent amount of money,  I just need to know exactly where to start.  They are awful emotional and physically abusive people.  <lb><lb>I just really need people with experience to give me steps to take.  I do have a fair amount of documentation over the years and can count on people to back me up. <lb><lb>Thanks ! 
6m2s8d	APStudents	AP Delay Code Explanation (Code 93)	So I had just looked at my AP scores and my AP Computer Science A score had a Code 93 (score delay).

What is a code 93 and will I get my score back?<lb><lb>Update: Called CB. That said that something was marked for review but their investigation came up empty so I should be getting my scores. If anyone else gets a Code 93 or other delay codes, just call CB.

Any ideas on what I should be looking for?
4wwmeq	sleeptrain	Nap training after sleep training	"Is it normal to feel like starting NAP training is ""starting over""?  We Ferberized for bedtime about a month ago and things have been going so great.  However, for NAPS, baby has always relied on the bouncer, or the stroller or Ergo.  Once in a while he'd fall asleep post-nursing and could be transferred to another spot.  Anyway we recently decided that since we feel we've ""mastered"" bedtime to a degree, it was time to slay the second beast: naps.  Um .... I'm very surprised by how much he's fighting this - wailing for minutes on end and acting very mad.  It feels like starting over.  I thought it would be so much easier after we got bedtime down . . . Is this typical?"
6f88xs	fatpeoplestories	I made a fat woman into a sprinter	This is going to be a pretty short one but it occurred to me that it belonged here. <lb><lb>Recently I ran my first ever marathon. The trail was so poorly marked it ended up being an ultra because I went off course several times. Thus, by the end of it, all my muscles were screaming in agony and I could hardly take a step. <lb><lb>The next day I head to Wally World to pick up a few things. I am full out hobbling at this point. My pace is a slow, painful limp. As I pass the doors there's only one motor scooter. To be clear, I had NO INTENTION of taking said scooter. Never even occurred to me. Apparently I looked like someone who needed it though. Enter fat lady. <lb><lb>She was so desperate to get the last motor scooter that when she saw someone hobbling towards it who as far as she knew actually needed it, she BROKE INTO A SPRINT. It was the fastest I've ever seen a fat person move. She sprinted past me as fast as she could and settled into the scooter, then victoriously scooted off into the sunset. <lb><lb>I hobbled past her in the store later on and she gave me the smuggest look. Like yes, good job, lady, you managed to defeat me in my quest for the scooter.

Does anyone else know how to fix this?  I do enjoy the ads because that's how I found out about the Buy 1 get 1 free GTA shark cards in November 2016 that nobody else even had going on.

5jolef	Firefighting	Help writing story about volunteer firefighters	"So, I'm a volunteer firefighter myself, and I was very interested in the histiry of the fire service in the cities before the paid fire service was formed. I'm looking into writing a story about an alternate universe where paid firefighting never became commonplace in the US, and volunteers instead continued to provide a majority of fire services to even the largest of cities. Paid firefighters are around, but volunteers still outnumber them greatly, and practically the only department that has no volunteers is the Federal Government/Military.<lb><lb>I would assume (and to an extent, hope) the technology in use in this bizarro world fire service isn't too different than today, except maybe some older equipment that isn't commonly in use today (three-quarter boots, long coats, belt-mounted regulators on SCBA, pompier ladders) never fully died out. I would also assume most VFDs in the cities would switch to the Prince George's County model of staffing to cope with rising call volumes and obviously don't use bells or sirens and whatnot to summon firefighters.<lb><lb>Would fights at fires still be a thing? Would old habits and terminology like ""washing the tub"" (pumping so fast that you cause the next pumper in line to overflow with water and overpower the pump), ""plug uglies"" (guys who would guard hydrants and stop outside companies from hooking up to them), and ""masheen"" (old term for fire apparatus) still be in use today? Would EMS even be a thing in the fire service? How much political power would this much, much larger volunteer fire service have? Would there still be a decline in volunteer firefighters like in real life? How would most of these departments be organized? How would newer areas like South Florida and the Southwest in general develop in particular?<lb><lb>Now, as for the story, what city should I cover? Also, you can leave a suggestion for a fire company name, something along the lines of Vigilant, or Perseverance, or Torrent, or Liberty, or Neptune most likely."

4uv3g8	factorio	Some help requested	So I started my second world recently and I just wanted to ask for some mods that just give me a bit more information or that include shortcut keys to streamline my gaming session. Sadly enough I am forced to using a trackpad and therefor I find it easier to use shortcuts instead of having to drag my finger to the correct icon. And with the information I mean like stuff of potential power output instead of having to guess, clearer minimap (easier to see information at a glance) and stuff about potential production in the production menu. I think this has been asked before (most likely) so a link to those posts will also suffice as long as some good answer are given in said post. Thanks alot!

63rd5p	climbing	Question about setting up top rope anchor	I recently started climbing outdoors. I was shown to make a self-equalizing anchor (with the x) using a sling and 4 locking carabiners, and have done that since. However I've seen people make their anchor many other different ways. For example, with 2 slings instead of 1, with a cordette in a quad instead of a sling, or just 2 quickdraws (is the lase one somehow unsafe...?)<lb><lb>I'm curious about the different setups. Are they better (or worse) than what I'm doing now? Are there situations where one is more appropriate than an other? Or is it more just personal preference?

4wjq4k	osugame	Training Fingers	I just wanted to know what /r/osugame's opinion was on whether or not stream training maps (those long maps that only have streams) are a good way to train your fingers to that BPM. I know for streaming in general this isn't efficient but in regards to simply getting your fingers to stream a certain range of BPMs, how good is it?
5vjxmm	spartanrace	Arizona Spartan Saturday Detour	I just wanted to spread the word since I didn't see it posted but if anyone is running the Arizona Sprint on Saturday keep in mind the Phoenix Marathon is happening the same day. I saw this was posted in a Spartan Facebook group. Check the map on the marathon website to see if your hotel or route to Fort McDowell will be impacted. This also could be the reason why the Sprint is on Saturday instead of Sunday. Would be badass to run a marathon and then Spartan up after haha.<lb><lb>https://thephoenixmarathon.com/<lb><lb>
6j08ep	needforspeed	Changing how the cars sounds when you change the exhaust in NFS2015.	So I remember seeing BlackPanthaas videos before NFS 2015 came out, after playing the E3 build he mentioned in many of his videos that you could change how the car sounds by changing different types of exhausts. I don't think this actually happens when you change exhausts and the car pretty much sounds the same. What are your thoughts?
65l1c9	Cruise	Cruise to Caribbeans	Hi. I'm wondering what cruise ships that you recommend from experience for someone looking for a cruise to the Caribbeans in early June. Some pros and cons of certain companies could be helpful. Also looking for tips on what to do at the port stops. Thanks<lb><lb>Edit - Would anyone recommend one over the other for Labadi/San Juan vs Nassau and Charlotte Amalie?<lb><lb>Thanks for all the replies<lb><lb>Edit 2 - I'm in my 20s and going with my family. Just looking for things to see and do at the possible locations and wondering if one of the destinations has more to do than the other. I enjoy scenic landscapes and shopping.
7qv79w	blackmirror	Black Mirror Shut Up And Dance (S3 E3) made me think...	What would you do if someone sends you a video in which you're jerking off and starts blackmailing you, but you're watching normal porn so you tell them to go fuck off and release it. But then they send you a video of you jerking off and your screen at the same time, but instead of the normal porn that you were watching they've put cp. What would you do then? If you still went ahead and told them to fuck off, how would you explain it to the police after the video is released? Also, don't forget that they have a trojan horse on your computer so they can edit your browser history and put whatever they want in there. 
6hkeeo	China	Samsung phones on China flights	"A family member of mine tells me that while flying around China last week, she heard on the intercom something about Samsung phones not being permitted on flights. <lb>I immediately assumed she probably heard ""Samsung Galaxy Note 7"" (the specific model with the exploding battery issue) rather than all Samsung phones in general, and granted she's not very tech-savvy.<lb><lb>Could someone please clarify for me any such restriction? I am getting a Galaxy S8 Plus, and plan on visiting China around winter.<lb><lb>Thanks!"

54yzed	Cubers	Prizes for Comps, starting with the current one, #200!	I am rather excited to announce that, starting with the current competition, the cubicle will resume random prizes for our weekly competition.  As per the previous prize structure, every competition will get $5, and every tenth will get $10 instead.  The prize will be given to a random competitor every week, and I will try to make a video of the selection to confirm fairness (Random.org woohoo!)

7edxhd	Warframe	so question about how useful zaw's are.	"Are zaws anything to even touch? i get some are best in class and the justification really tilts me. yes. they are best in class, one handed swords, daggers, polearms, etc etc BUT these are all clases that for the most part are bad... bad end game and bad dps/range... i mean look at daggers? their entire use is use covert and make something open to finishers. even using the new stance that forces finishers that 4-8? hits? ""i havnt used it"" for 1 kill at point blank range... im just curious are zaw's actually GOOD for anything? are their any arcanes that make them good? or more importantly BETTER or more enjoyable to use than other fully built weapons? "
5ypvql	Professors	"I'm a librarian and ""instructor"" at a community college with a few baccalaureate programs. How should students address me?"	I never know what title I should use at work. I am a faculty librarian. I'm a pretty informal human so I tend to think everyone, including students, should call me by my first name. However, I think it's awkward for some students and possibly diminishes my authority as an instructor and librarian. Does anybody have advice on this? I have a MLS, not a doctorate.

8jgbv8	AvPD	Someone Should Know	I'm undiagnosed but I know I have AVPD. I've been trying to talk to a therapist for a few years but I can never talk about my feelings. I've always had anxiety problems and it has effected every aspect of my life. I dropped out of high school and tried to get my GED but gave up on that. I can't find the courage to learn how to drive, let alone go into the dmv. I live in a rural town and can't drive so I rarely leave my house. I've never had a job and I can't even imagine doing an interview for a job. All of these things make it impossible for me to convince some girl to ever be in a lasting relationship with me (which has never happened). I'll be 24 this year and I just can't see things getting better for me. I've given myself an expiration date. If I don't make any progress by the time I'm 40 I'm going to end it. The thought used to scare me. It still does. I don't want to die. Especially not without experiencing life. But I can't keep suffering without it meaning something. I'll keep going to therapy and trying to get better but I don't want to live with the regret of wasting away. That was my rant. I've never told anyone how I feel and I figured this is the best place to go.
